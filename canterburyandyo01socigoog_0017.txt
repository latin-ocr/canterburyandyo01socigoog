The name of Cantilupe appears ¹in two of the varying
forms of the Battle Roll of HastingS, and the early home of the
follower of the Conqueror has been thought to be a village of
that name in la Manche,¹ apparently 011 110 other grounds than

the existence of a Chateau there, which was of some importance ἢ

centuries later ς the owners of this, however, had a different
coat of arms from those of the same name in England. It is
hard to speak with any confidence upon the subject, for the families
who dwelt in the wolf's haunts² must have grown apace and wan-
dered widely, since in France alone there are nearly thirty places
which are known now by the name in slightly different forms.³ It
seems more probable, however, ‘that the starting point of Duke
William's follower was a village near Evreux in Eure, which
also bore the name, in or 11661· the lordship oi Breteuil, in a
district with whose ruling families some of 1116 descendants had
intimate relations. Several fiefs in the neighbourhood belonged
to Canttilupes who lived in England somewhat later, before the
choice had to be made between estates 011 either 61116 of the
Channel. It was there, as will be seen, that the future Saint
retired for many months to find peace in a region where his
mother Milioent must have been known as Countess oi Evreux
and daughter of Hugh de Goumay‚⁴ names associated with
broad lands that had passed away from the English branchos.

On his father’s side, the family, which had taken root
at Aston·Cantelow in Warwickshire‚ had been conspicuous for
several generations, evil councillors of King John and his

4-Τ116τ6 is a strange story, written in the name of Dame Juliana Tregoz. the sister
of the Bishop. telling how the widowed Queen. Blanche of castille. married 6 noble
chevalier. Sir Hugh de Gom-nav. “one of the most valiant in the world.'' and that at
his death St. Leuis “with the greatest lon-ds in ἤιε-1161116613· to do him honour. went
down into the mud which came halfway up their legs. and taking the body from the
litter. carried it through the city of Rouem where it was buried. (Dodsworth MSS. 64.
