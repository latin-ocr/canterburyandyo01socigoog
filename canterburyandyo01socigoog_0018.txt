son Henry, as Matthew Paris puts it,¹ and strong supporters
of the Crown against the Banons. William, the second baron,
was grand seneschal of the kingdom, and one of the co-regents
during the King's absence in Gascony in 1242 and the follow·
ing year, when his great influence is evidenced in the many
references to him—nearly two hundred—in ¹‘che official des-
patches sent thence to England at thaat time.² In his own
and in his father's days the family estates had been largely
incmased by royal favour and—like the felix Austria——by
alliances in marriage. The second baron bought the ward-
ship of five great estates, marrying his war-ds into his own
family. His successor married Eva Bracae, who brought him
Abergavenny as her dower. The list of his son's possessione
recorded at his death was a very long one, and included
estates in twelve different countiues.⁸ The brothers of the
second baron also married heiresses3 John held Snitterfield in
Warwickshire by right of his wife, Margaret Cumin 3 John
acquired Gresley in Nottinghamshine by union with Eustachia,
whose son succeeded also to l'lkeston in Derbyshire. Another

branch was settled at Deighton in Yorkshire. The family name
therefore survived in various localities in England, though these

are not so numerous as in Franco.⁴

Whatever may be thought of them as politicis-ns, they were
exemplary churchmen according to the standard of the age5
one William enriched Studeley Priory where he was afterwards
inter-red 3 others founded Beauvale at Gresley‚ and endowed with
their grants the conventa of Bruton‘⁵ and Montacute.⁸

Thomas de Cantilupe⁷ was born about 1218, not in the

s—Inquia. post morum. lst year Edw. 1.

⁴—Besides Aston-Cantelow. the family name was attached to a Hempston (in Deven-
chire). and to a Chilton‚ near Yeovil. which was the domain of Sir R. Cantilupe in the
uth century (Drokensford Rea.. p. 2³7. somerset Record. Soc.). Cantlop. or cantelope. in
the hundred of Condover. was so-named before the Norman conquest, and was after·
wan-ds in the possession of the Burnells. Another cantelope. in Shropshire. belonged to
nugo de Wulonkelowe (laquis. p. m. 101), and probably derived its name from a distinct
source. The prebend of St. PauPs cathedral. called Cantlers or Kentillers. from which
Kentish Town is said to drive its name. has been thought to be connected with the family.
but though a Roger de Cantilupe was Prehendary of St. Paul's in 12⁴9 (Le Neve. 111. ⁴⁰³)
and another of the same surname was Dean later in the century. no evidence has been
produced to wat-rant this assumption. yet later fancy has made Kentish 'town the

favour-ite residence of the Saint.

7—By a carious mistake Dugdale (Bao-onage. 1. ⁵7³) makes Thomas the chancellor the
uncle of Thomas of Heretord. and the brother of Walter. Bishop of Worcester. This has

been repeated by Banks and in later books.
