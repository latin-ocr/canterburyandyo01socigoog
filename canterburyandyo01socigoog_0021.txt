fugitives from Constantinop103 by the middle of the century
the works lately forbidden became the authorized text-books
in the lecture rooms of the Faculty of Arts. It was to
study in this Faculty that the two brothers came to Paris ς
they were enrolled therefore under some Master who was
8 member in the one of the four Nations which was called
the English, though it included all the studente who were
not drawn from any part of what now is France. Its
name shews that many flocked thither from England, 88 do
also the frequent references to Paris in the Registers of the
English Bishops‚ when licences of non-residence were given to
young incumbente and Archdeacons who desired to pass 8 few
years at some seat of general study.

Four or five years must elapse till the Bachelors' degree was
reached 3 before that each candidate must pass 8 kind of
‘ Responsions ' by disputing (respondere) in Logic, and be able to
produce evidence of attendance at the necessary Lectures. That
done, he was qualified to ‘ determine,' that is, to maintain 8 thesis
publicly in the Rue du Fouarre‚ and meet the arguments
of rival students; this being apparently 8 common practice
before it became 8 statutory obligation, thirty years or more

there, more favoured or more enterprising than the rest. The
range of study had indeed extended beyond the Triviam and
the Quadrivium, which were taught, 88 elsewhere, in the Cathe-
dral School at Hereford in the 12th century, when a Canon²
invited the eminent scholar Giraldus Cambrensis to take up

his abode there.
Flamit, et floret, et in hac specialiter urbe
Artis septem predominatur honos.

Hunc, ubi tot radiant artes, de jure teneris,
Cum sis artis home, artis amare locum.
