vi Introduction.

But the Rhetoric of the Triviam then included more of the
real literature of the Latin writers, and its influence is
seen in the more graceful style of 9 John of Salisbury or
Giraldus. The wider outlook of the next century was
mainly in Philosophy, for ‘the ban pronounoed a while against
much of Aristotle’s works was removed when the Cantilupes
were not long settled in their course of study; but for
some time they were chiefly occupied with grammar and logic‚
with a sparing admixture of psychology. Only later in their
terms could they attend the lectures in the ethics 91111 1119
other treatises of the Greek Philosopher.

This one-sided training is reflected in the litei-ary style.
It cannot be said that the 1911919 of Popes and Bishops
included in this Register are models of graceful composition.
The Lecturers for their part were 09191999 of literary finish3
their main object was to divide 91111 sub-divide the theme,
and to distinguish and desine, that the whole might be
mapped out with minute precision. They were hampered also
by the scholars’ natural desire 10 take it all down as from
dictation, notwithstanding the directions which from time to
time were ineffectus-Hy given. Books 11919 few3 scholare often
were very poor, and anxious to make a library of note-books. But
if 1119 class had to squat upon the floor, like Arab children,
as was said to be the good old custom,¹ they could not
find it easy to write their notes at large.

There was one side of University life in which the
Cantilupes were not likely to take part ς they would not be
found in the tavei-ns of the suburbe, drinking ‘ good sweet
wine,’ and quarrelling with the vintner, like the studente at
the Bourg Saint-Marcel in 1229? whose fray with the citizens
and the police brought about 9 general secession to other 99919
of study‚ which ended after two years of dispersion in the
enlargement of their academie privileges, 91111 1119 discomfiture
of their opponente. For the brothers came ‘ en grands seigneurs‚'
with 9 considerable following, under the charge of 9 Μ99191· of
Arts, who was afterwards seneschal of Bishop Walter. Their life
was exemplary and devout, 99 vouched for in 19191· days by
