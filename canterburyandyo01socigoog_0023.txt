Gantilupe at Paris. vii

a member of the household‚1 with early masse· and ample
benefactione to the poor.

Canon Robert le Wyse of Gloucester, one of the witnesses
who gave evidence after the Bishop’s death, spoke of hi·
‘ inception ' in Arts at Paris. If the term was used in its
strict sense, it implied that two years after he ‘ determined '
or became a Bachelor, he presented himself for examination,
conducted a disputation in the ‘ Quodlibets,’ and applied for
the formal licence from the Chaucellor by which he became
qualified to begin (incipere) to teach 111 the Faculty of Arts.
The whole course therefore would have lasted some six or
seven years, ending with the inaugural disputation, and with
the customary banquet to the Masters at his expense; which
could not be dispensed with, and had to be followed by forty
days of continuous disputation, and 8 residence of some years
as lecturer‚ if this last was not formally excused.

Meantime some steps were taken in the ecclesiastical
career. Benefices were bestowed upon him by his uncle as
well as by other patrone. In Feb. 1244 a Papal dispensa-
tion allowed him to hold another benefice besides Wintring-
ham which he almady had, and this was followed by a
further grant which enabled the two brothers, ‘ whose nobility,
learning, and elegance of manners speak for them,’ to enjoy
more preferment.² By the practice of the age this would
not carry with it any obligation of continued residence in
England, or indeed of Holy Orders beyond the earlier stages,
but the evidence of friends and admirers at a later date
implies in his 0888 8 111018 than usual regard for the respon-
sibilities incurred.

The First Council of Lyons in 1245 which he attended,
like his brother, 111 the capacity of Papal Chaplain, must have
supplied further materiale to mature his judgment. Innocent
IV, who summoned it, had been in humbletr rank the partisan
and seeming friend of Frederick ΙΙ, but, by a change of
attitude more complete that that of Becket, 118 now called
the representatives of Christendom together to crush and to
dethrone his rival. No large numbers answered to the call,
for the Emperor’s power was paramount over wide regions,
