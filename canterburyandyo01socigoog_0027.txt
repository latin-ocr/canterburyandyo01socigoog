The Study of Canon Law. xi

BishopS, while they qualified themselves by study for the
duties of the offices to which they were promoted. In the
pages of the Register examples may be found ,·¹ and with their
position thus assured there can be little doubt that the young
ecelesiastica did not for the most part work too hard. The
course was in a later age a long one, lasting six years before
the degree of Bachelor could be taken, though it might be
shortened if civil Law had been already studied. For a
lioence three or four years more were needed; and this could
not be dispensed with for a future lecturer in the subject.
It was probably during this period of probation, and among
these opportunities of intercourse with titled Englishmen, that
we may place the complimentary visit oi the French King to
his lodgings of which Robert of Gloucester had heard some
vague account.¹ The austere aelf-discipline of Louis IX may
well have stirred the admiration of the student; it would cer-
tainly have been a congenial example at a later date.

During this period of his residence at Paris he could
hardly fail to be deeply interested in the long dispute between
the Dominican Friars and the University authorities, though it
concerned especially the Theological faculty of which he was
not yet a member.. The Friars Preachers, intended by their
founder to be champions of the Faith, had soon settled them-
selves, as a matter of course, in the great centre of general
study at Paris. Received there with a ready welcome, and
encouraged by Papal favour, they held aloof from all con-
certed action with the other Masters, and refused to submit
to the authority of the Theological faculty whose privileges
they enjoyed. The University, which excluded them from fellow-
ship in consequence, was required to re·admit them by a Papal
Bull, the Quasi liywam, and though it formally dissolved its
corporate organization in order to escape control, the pressure
was too strong, and the Mendicants finally prevailed.⁸ The per-
tinacious seli-assertion oi the Order caused much beart-burning
at Oxford and at Hereford, but these troubles were in later
days; some indication of them may be found even in this
Begister,‘ and there are many more among the Chapter deed8.⁶
