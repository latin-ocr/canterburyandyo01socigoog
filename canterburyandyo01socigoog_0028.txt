xii Introduction.

What Cantilupe had learned at Paris and at Orleans
he came, we are told, to teach at Oxford. It was a common
practice in his age for men who loved a life of letters to
pass from one University to another, and ‘gladly learn and
gladly teach’ in various seats of learning. His contemporary
Peckham, for example, went in early youth to Paris, was
reader in Divinity at Oxford, returned to Paris, and was
lecturer afterwards at Rome. Young studente, attracted by a
European reputation, sought their Professors wherever they could
find them. So the earneet-minded crowded round the sagea
of old Greece; travelled from place to place to make themselves
disciples of some famous teacher ; and hung upon his lips to get

more light, if might be, on the etet-nal problems of men’s destiny
and duty.

There are apparently no data as to the exact time at
which Cantilupe transferred his residence to Oxford, but he must
have been there some years before the highest office in the Uni-
versity was conferred upon him, one not likely to be given to
a stranger little known. There was some excitement in men's
minds there, which mIght remind him of what he had been
familiar with at Paris. The University resented the renewed
attempta of the Diocesan, the Bishop of Lincoln, to exercise
authority from which it claimed to have been set free, and
in 1256 a deputation of nine ‘⁴ Artists”—as Wood calls them—
laid their grievancee before the King. Matthew Paris, who
had frequent access to the royal presence, warned him, as he
tells ue, to be careful of the critical condition of the Church‚-
‘⁸ The University of Paris, foster-mother of so many holy
prelates, is in no slight perturbation; if Oxford, the second
school of the Ohurch, or rather its mainstay, be at the same
time disturbed in the same way, there is danger of total ruin
to it.” ‘¹ Heaven forbid that,” said Henry, “most of all in
my days.”¹ Α compromise was accordingly arranged, with
terme of peace. There was greater trouble still in 1258 .
Feuds of long standing between rival factione issued in a
general fray between the Northernem, aided by the Welsh,
and the Southerners, and in this a brother of the Welsh Prince
was killed, and many were seriously wounded. Iu their fear
of the KIng's displeasure they proposed to give large peace-
