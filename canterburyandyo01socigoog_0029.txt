The Chaucellorship at Oxford. xiii

offerings to the members of the royal family.' Henry replied
that he valued the lite of any of his subjecte too highly ior
any price that could be paid. But the disturbances of the malm,
and the wat-like movements that ensued, diverted attention from
Academic questione, though in the Lent following there was
renewed offence, in the rescue of 8, criminal who with eid of
scholare broke out of prison, and sought sanctum-y, and abjured
the kingdom. The affray at Oxford was a. prelude to more
serious strife, as is implied in the old rhyme¹

A deed oi conveyance of ground belonging to the Abbey
of Oseney to the Fratres de Ponitentia was attested in 1262 by
Thomas de Cantilupe as Ohancellor, but we are not told how
long before or afterwards he held the office. The election to
the post, which was tenable for two yearS, was made by certain
regent Masters nominated by the Proctors, with confirmation by
the Bishop of Lincoln, and it carried with it large and varied
powers. The legal training of many years must have served
him in good stead, for the Chaucellor was ex officio a Justice
of the peace, and before his court, or that of his delegatos, all
suits were brought in which membere oi the University were
concerned; his powers in regard to these included imprison·
ment, excommunication‚ and banishment. Litigation was very
frequent, and the number of advocates extremely large;
effrenata multitudo advocatorum is the language of an ordi-
nance of 1300.Ἰ Τ118 familiarity oi Cantilupe with 811811 pro-
cedure may in part account for the frequent occurrence of
legal matter in his Register. The Chaucellor had also a large
administrative and financial competence which brought him into
close relatione with the townsfolk, not always to their satis-
faction in regard to markets and assize. But of such griev-
ances we find no mention. The classes concerned have left
no materiale for history; the admirere and the members oi his
1181188118111,13 who reported at a later date, spoke only eulogies
oi the firmness of his administrative action, oi the strict
discipline with which he disarmed unruly studente, and main-
tained impartial justice without regard to personal affronts. Of
