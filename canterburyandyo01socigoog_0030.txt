xiv Introduction.

the next year however (1263), when he was possibly in office
still, so favourable an account could not be given. Peace was
disturbed by threatening movements of the armed forces of the
King and of the barons; the sympathies of the students were
mostly with the latter—and with this perhaps the influence of
Cantilupe may have been connected,-so the civil authorities
thought it prudent to close their gates when Princo Edward
was marching by, early in February, in fear of possible collision.
Hot·headed youngsters, impatient of restraint, presently broke
down a gate and forced their way outside, causing a riot for
which the ring-leaders were arrested. The Chancellor applied
in vain for their release; the townsmen, provoked by taunts
or elated by success, renewed the strife3 but the gownsmen
gathering in force swept all before them, pillaged the shops
oi leading citizens, and broke open the casks of the Mayor
who was a vintner.¹ A contemporary, who put English history
into rhyming verse, was present at the scene, which he described
in some detail, and as he was probably a Canon of Hereford,'
and prominent in giving evidence of the saintly life of Cantilupe,
a few of his lines may here be quoted as a specimen of the
English people's language at that date.⁸
‘¹ And wounded ther was manion, ac the borgeis athe laste,

Hii begonne to fle vaste3 hom thoghte longe er ;

So that the clerkes adde the stretes sone iler ;

The bowiare ssoppe hii breke, and the bowes nome echon;

Suththe the portereues house; hii sette afure anon

In the south half of the toune, and suththe the spicerie

Hii breke fram ende to other, and dude al to robberie3

Vor the mer was vinitor, hii breke the viniterie,

And alle othere in the town, and that was lute maistrie.”

The mature scholar was soon called away to other work
upon a different scene. King Henry had borne with impatience
from the first the galling restrictione imposed upon his power
by the Provisions of Oxford; a Pope had no scruple in declaring

2—The Robert of Gloucester of the metrica! history mas be probably identified with
the Canon of the same name. also styled le wyse. who is often mentioned in this Regis-
ter. and who gave evidence at the Commission of inquii-y in 1³⁰⁷. The writer was at
Oxiord with Cantilupe. and shews intimate acquaintance with soenes at Hereford con-
nected with Bishop Peter: the Canon also had familiar knowledge of the career at
oxford. where he seems to hate been at the same time. The belief that the versifici·
was a monk rests on no evidence whatever.
