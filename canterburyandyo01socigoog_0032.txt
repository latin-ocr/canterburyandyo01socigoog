with his own hande, and had it sealed in his own presence‚”
as the Scribe noted in the Patent Roll.¹ A grant of five
hundred marks a year was made, to include the support of
the Clerks of the Royal Chancery. The Roll of the house-
hold expensos oi the Countess oi Leicester contains an inci-
dental notice at this time that illustratos the ruling influent:
which determined his appointment. On March lst there is a

entry of a complimentary gift of wine sent to the Ohaucellor at
Salisbury, and a special messenger was despatched with letters
to him in J uly.’ The Earl of Leicester had attended at the
funeral of William de Cantilupe at Studeley in 1251, and there
seem to have been close relations between the families con-

cerned.

There are few signs of the official activity of the new
Chancellor; early in May he delivered the Great Seal to the
Keeper oi the Wardrobe to be kept till his return, we know
not whence; a little later, when the royalists were already in
the field, the King gave instructions—dictated of course by those
in power—that Thomas de Cantilupe, it he should be still ln
London, should take action with others named to regulate the
affairs of the Jewry‚ “without giving heed to Prince Edward
or his officials.''⁸ Little further is recorded beyond the testimony
of his admirers that he would accept no gifts from importunate
suitors, and was ready to resign his office rather than set his
seal to deeds unworthy of the King.⁴ But as Henry was iu
fact a prisoner, and his control purely nominal, the risk could
not have been great.

The battle of Evesham closed the period, of civil etrite,
and on Aug. 18th the Great Seal passed into other hands by
the King’s unfettered choico. The ex·Chancellor received the
King's pardon soon afterwards,⁶ but went back to his books
again, and probably without regret. Though Archdeacon of
Stafford, and largely beneficed‚ the ripe scholar seemed to need
yet more to quality him for his ecclesiastical career. He
returned therefore to Paris, at the age of forty-seven, to add
the study of Theology to the courses in the three Faculties

through which he had already passed. It was at this time
