that he came into close relations with two future Archbishops
of Canterbury, both of them eminent in the Lecture-Halls of
Paris, from whom he received afterwards in England treatment
of a very different kind, Robert Kilwardby, a Dominioan‚ who
was also his Confessor, and John Peckham, a Fransciscan Friar.

ἱ 0 The course in Theology was commonly a long one. For four

years expositione on the books of Scripture were attended‚ and
for two more years lectures on the Sentences of Peter Lombard;
after this an examination might be passed, and the licence for a
degree having been obtained, the Bachelor could publicly expound
some book of Scripture. Survivors of the Bishop testified that
they had heard him deliver lectures of a cursory kind—that
is, at some time when the regular lectures were not given, or
in some less formal manner,—both on the Apoealypse and on
the Canonical Epistles.² How much time this occupied is not
definitely known, but it is recorded in an Episcopal Register
that in 1268 a further dispensation for three years was granted
him that he might study Theology while absent from his clerical
duties in the diocese of Worcester‚ and an attorney was appointed
to do suit in the Bishop’s court for lands in N orton under
Bredon.²

After some years he returned to Oxford and became a
regent Master in the Faculty in which he had been studying
at Paris (rexit in Theoloqia). At the ceremony of conferring
the degree Kilwardby, now Archbishop‚ delivered from his own
personal knowledge a set eulogy‚ such as was customary after
the Vesperioe, or the formal disputation on the eve of the
inception, declaring him to be pure and blameless, ‘⁸ unspotted
from the world.”⁸

For a year and four months he remained there to lecture,
and during that period he was elected to the Chaucellor-
ship again, the duties of which office he relinquished in the
year 1274, when another interest called him away from
England.

A second time, after the lapse of nearly thirty years he
was present as Papal Chaplain at a General Counoil held,
