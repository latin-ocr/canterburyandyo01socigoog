xviii Introduction.

the First. The Ghair of St. Peter was now filled by the
noble-minded Gregory X„ whose schemen of ambition centred
in the rescue of the Holy Land‚ which was to follow on the
union of a divided Christendom. Bishops and dignified eccle·
siastics flocked in crowds from every quarter to take part
in the reconciliation of the Greek and Roman ChurcheS‚ and
in the furtherance of ecclesiastical reforma. Among them came
the mature scholar with personal experience enough of civil
strife and a disorganized Ohurch at home to welcome gladly
the ideals of peace and union, with beneficent safeguards and
correctione, which were laid before the Council. He may have
met a great Archbishop who was also there, Eudes Rigaud of
Rouen, who was well-known to have been indefatigable for
years in the visitation of his diocese, as described in his jour-nal
in minute detail.1 The memory of his resolute example was
perhaps not lost on Cantilupe‚ who must have heard in early
days of the artifices by which the monks of Tewkesbury evaded
his uncle’s questions when he came on his unwelcome visita—
tions. At the Council beneficent reforms were in the air:
but soon the guiding spirit of the movement passed away, and
with him the bright visione oi the Kingdom of God, and
the hopes of enduring progress. But the frequent references to
the Gouncil in the pages of this volume shew that some prac-
tical steps were taken without delay to grapple with the abuses
of Ghurch Order‚ and that Cantilupe in the administration of
his diocese was entirely loyal to the regulations framed at
Lyons. The efficiency oi the parochial system had been fatally
enfeebled. Ghurches were given in commendam; their custody
was entrusted to laymen, who might have no intention to
proceed immediately, or even at all, to Holy Orders; patrone
presented their children to rich benefices while they were still
boys at school; foreigners, by provision from the Pope,
claimed the enjoyment of the tithes of parishes in which they
never lived. It was some check on these abusos when the
Gouncil decreed that no unqualified person should be admitted
to the custody of any church for more than six months at a
time; that those presented to a benefice who were in minor
Orders should be bound to proceed in due course to the priest-
hood; and that residence should be enforced except aiter
