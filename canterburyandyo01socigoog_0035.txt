Cantilupe's benefice& xix

formal dispensation of the Ordinsry. The mention of the
Gouncil in the entries of the Register¹ means commonly that
these decrees would be eniorced, and the numerous cases of
acolytos and sub-descons presented by the patrons—-snd those
religione houses often—illustrate the laxity of recent usage. The
regulations could not indeed be stringently enforced. Patrone
were too powerful, public opinion was too weak, to make it
possible to ignore claims confidently made.

Moved probably by the strong language lately heard at
Lyon8‚ Cantilupe returned no more to any scene of Academic
study, but gave more time and thought to the benefices which
he held. These, we know, were many, though we have no
certain dats. to enable us to make out an exhaustive list, or
ascertain how long they were in his charge, for some of the
Episcopsl Begisters do not exist and entries oi the institutione

Deighton, where the Yorkshire Cantilupes were settled after-
wards, was given him by Dame Agatha Trussebut in 1247 ;⁶
Hampton Episcopi in the diocese of Worcester was a gift
almost certainly of his uncle Walter, like the churches of
Rippel and Kempsey, which were slso mauors of the See;
Dodderhill he may have owed to that Bishop’s influence with
the patrous, the Prior and Convent of Worcester. Another,
Snitterfield in thc same diocese, near Stratiord-on-Avon, came
to him probably from his uncle John, who possessed the 11161161·
