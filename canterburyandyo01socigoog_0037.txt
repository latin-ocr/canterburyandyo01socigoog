The alencion at Hereford. xxi

died in 1273, shortly after he came 01 age, and left no
issue. The estates passed to his two sisterS‚ of whom Milicent
by 8 second marriage became the wife of Eudo la Zouche,
ancestor of the Lords Zouche of Haringworth, who 18 named
several times in our Register as patron of some family livings.¹
The other sister married Henry, Lord Hastings, ancestor of the
Earls 01 Pembroke. Another uncle, Nicholas, had also died,
leaving a son and heir who was brought into the King's Court
on May 15, 1275, 811ᾱ delivered to the King by his uncle
Thomas„ as his marriage was at the disposal of the Crown.
But he received him back again to be kept during the King’s
pleasure.²

de Conflen8,⁴ Archdeacon 01 Hereford, and Luke de Bree (or
Bray), Canon, brought the official tidings of his death, and
licence was given to the Dean and Chapter to proceed to an
8166110111ς Cantilupe preached before the Chapter on the eve
of the day fixed for that event. There was no agreement at
the first; the choice was therefore left in the hands of a
Committee specially appointed for the purpose (compromissarii) ,-
these with one accord declared that they would have
Thomas for their head. It 18 reported that there were several
Canons who had the same Christian name, and that the
question was asked eagerly‚ ‘ which Thomas ’⁴2⁶ . The compotus

Chapter who bore the same Christian name, but they do not
