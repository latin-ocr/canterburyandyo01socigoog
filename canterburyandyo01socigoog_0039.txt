The influence os Peter de Aquablanca. xxiii

disturbed the peace of the Cathedral and the City by the
sends between their partisans, and the excommunicatione which
were scattered freely in their names ;ι while the corrective
jurisdiction over the whole Deanery was, to his grief, entirely
in abeyance.² The animosities in question hegan at a much
earlier date, and to understand them fully we must go back
to the times of Peter de Aquablanca, who ruled the diocese
from 1240 to 1268. A Savoyard favourite of Henry ΙΙΙ, he
was long his trusted minister in affairs of state, employed in
many confidential errands‚ and among others in the unscrupu-
lous artifice, as it was regarded, by which the clergy and
religious houses were pledged unwittingly to pay large sums to
Pope and King; this caused the good hater, Matthew Paris, to
say of him that his memory exhaled a sulphurous stench.⁸
Not content with the widespread odium thus provoked, he
engaged in a long quarrel with his Chapter, binding them with
Papal sanctioris to six months’ residence on their prebends,⁴
though himself for long periods absent from his diocese, and
further disputing their rights of property and customary claims.⁸
Meanwhile a swarm of kinsmen and follow-countrymen had
followed him to Hereford, and with his help were quartered
in the dignities and beneficos of the See. Here as elsewhere
the rapid rise of the intruders was resented‚ for it must be
owned· that Englishmen at this time was fiercely intolerant of
the foreigners amongst them. For their dislike of the Poitevin
and Savoyard favourites of the King there was indeed good
reason, as also of Italians who drew large sums by Papal pro-
vision from their churches ; but we may judge of their narrowed
sympathies when we find Spaniards spoken of as “ hideous in
their persons, contemptible in their dress, and detestable in their
manners.”⁶

At Hereford the presence of this intruded clement caused

much beart-hurning, and at times unseemly strife even within

presented by the patrona were instituted by the nean: the churches were visited by him;
the matrimoninl and testamentary business passed through the hands oi his officials:
and he had also powers of coer-cive discipline in faith and morale which brought him
into relation with all classes of the neoole. lt was the suspension of these which
Cantiluoe so much regn-ettad. Even ns late as the eighteenth century apparitore went to
and fro: offenders were summoned: and penitents in deletui guise were forced to confess
their sins in Church before the congregation.
