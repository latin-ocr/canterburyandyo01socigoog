Savoyards in H ereford. xxv

Aquablanca, the Bishop's nephew, had been put into his place,
after a short interval, by the voteS, we may suppose, of the
Savoyards and their friends in Chapter, u'nder pressure from
above, and John now appealed from Canterbury to Rome,
betaking himself there in person, while the suit dragged on
for yearS, till judgment was given in his favour. Meanwhile
Cathedral and City were distracted by the quarrelj, spiritual
curses were banded to and fro 3 the coercive jurisdiction of the
office was neglected to the grief of Cantilupe ; ¹ and Giles him-
self was unable to take possession of his place.²

John's uncle had left his sermons to him in his will, on
condition of the payment of fifty pounds of TourS, but we may
doubt if he cared much for such literature,⁸ and in his visits
to the Cardinals to expedite his suit ready money was more
useful. ’

John le Breton, the successor of Peter in the See, had
been canon himself, and under the influence of the party-spirit
of the past, he seems to have looked with an unfriendly eye
on the foreign influence imported. On some grounds only
vaguely mentioned, as requirements of right and order, he
deprived one of them, Peter de Langon, of his prebend, which
he offered to Cantilupe in 1273. The acceptance of it was a
questionable act on his part, showing perhaps more social pre-
judice than judgment. Certainly it brought him much trouble
and anxiety for the rest of his career. The ejected prebendary
appealed to Rome, and as Cantilupe did not reinstate him
when the prebend was vacated by himself, the suit which had
been begun dragged on for sixteen years in the dilatory Papal
Courts, costing the Bishop much expense and many letters to
his proctorS, in which he warned them to beware of the wiles
of the Burgundians, and of canons of Hereford who might be
on the spot.⁴ Meantime he had bestowed the prebend on
Henry de Woodstock‚ the Queen’s Chaucellor, who undertook
to bear the charges of the lawsuit, and to give instructions to
his agents,³ but still the Bishop’s reputation was at stake. At
length the plaintiff was reinstated, and heavy damages awarded
