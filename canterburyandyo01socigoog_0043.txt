The acceptance of the prebend of Preston by Cantilupe
under such questionable conditions, and the troubles that
ensued, could have left little doubt as to his sympathies when
questions were at issue between Burgundians and othere. His
decision therefore was a foregone- conclusion when disputes of
the kind were referred to his decision ; indeed he definitely
says on one occasion that he will not willingly plant in
his orchard. an exotio or unfruitful tree.⁴ Such a case
occurred in 1276 when there was a contested claim to the
prebend of Inkberrow between William Rufus and Humbert
de Yanua.,¹⁵ who was the Chanter of the collegiate church of
Aquabona, founded by Bishop Peter after the type of his own,
Cathedral Chapter. The question had been brought before the
Papal Courts, but both parties in the suit resigned themselves
unconditionally to the award of Cantilupe, which was promptly
given in favour of the English· claimant.⁶

The Bishop was soon made επακ-6, if he did not already
know, that the possessione of the See had suffered from aggres-
sive neighbours. His predecessor, John le Breton, believed till
lately to have been a notable lawyer in his day,‘' had shewn
supine indifference to such wrongs, but the reins were now in
stronger hande, and without delay the rights of the See were
fearlessly asserted in the face of powerful opponente. The first
of whom restitution was demanded was Llewelyn, Prince of
Wales. Some districts of the border lands appui-tenant to
Montgomery, when Earl Roger held it, had been granted early
in the thirteenth century to Bishop Giles de Braose by a son of
Robert de BollerS. This was seized in the King's name in
1224, as part of the Honour of Montgomery, but was restored
to Hugh Foliot on his appeal. It was again seized on the

same grounds by the Constable of Montgomery in 1261-4.
