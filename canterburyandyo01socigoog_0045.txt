Encroachments os the Oorbets. xxix

retired to a wood hard by, from which he issued presently in
full pontificale, with clergy at his side, and hurled anathemas
at all who ventured to obstruet the course of justice. The
Earl thereupon rode off, and the jury gave their verdict.¹ The
Earl's foresters, insolent and menacing before, were overawed,
and long afterwards some of them appeared as penitents before
the Bishop, and sued for formal 8118011111011.2

Α11 entry in the Register⁸ shews that the Bishop was
prepared to put his champion in the field, to whom 116 paid
an annual retaining fee to maintain his rights in duel. It was
still the practice at the end of the thirteenth century even for
religious dignitaries and convents to keep a professional duellist
for time of need. Thus the Annals of Worcester mention two
cases of the kind,⁴ and in the Archives at Hereford the
receipts are still preserved of the yearly payments of half a
mark which were made (pro feodo mco) to Robefi, le Bret‚ puyil
(1296), and to Robert de Melton Mowbray (1311) for services
when needed by the Dean and Chapter.

In a third suit Cantilupe disputed the pretensions of a
turbulent and litigious family on the Welsh borders of Shrop-
shire. The Corbets were great barons who came over in the
Conqueror's train from the Pays de Caux, and built a strong
castle which commanded the valley of the Rea, naming it, like
Earl Montgomery, after their Norman home.⁶ There they
were mighty 1111111618, 81111 Ρ6161· Corbet in 1281 was specially
commissioned by -the, King to desti-oy the wolves on his own
land and in neighbouring counties.⁶ Thomas Corbet, who had
been succeeded by his son Peter in 1274, had been busy in
lawsuits and disputes with his vassaIS‚ neighbourS, kinsmen, and
even with his son, and claimed peculiar rights over his Welsh
lands which withdrew them from the sphere of common law.
The family had suffered, like the See, from the aggressions of
Llewelyn, but on the other side had encroached, as was urged
by Cantilupe, upon the great manor of Lydbury, stretching over

landowner of early days, ngin Shakbeard, after his cure at
the shrine of St. Ethelbert. There it was urged in behalf of
