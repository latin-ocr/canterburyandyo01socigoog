xxx Introduction.

Cantilupe that much of a district called Longa Memida con-
taining froin five ιο seven miles of pasturage had been
annexed.¹ At his instance therefore a writ was issued, and
a perambulation of the land in dispute was arranged for March,
1278. A jury of belted knights was summoned, but several
were challenged by Peter Corbet, and the rest refused ιο act
without the due number of knights. At length, after remon-
strances and threats of fines, a proper perambulation was made,
and the boundaries fixed.²

Before Cantilupe's Consecration he wrote ’ ιο the civic
authorities of Hereford ιο beg them ιο respect the rights and
privileges of the Cathedral and its clergy.⁸ There had been
much friction in the past ; there were to be many quarrels in
the future ; and later pages of our Register illustrate in some
detail the causes that led repeatedly ιο collision and disputes.
The variety of· conflicting jurisdictione accounted for much of
the ill-feeling. The Church-land and the city-land: the King’s
men and the Bishop's men were marked off from each other
by their different rights aud obligations3 there was distinct
assize of bread and beer ; the shopkeepers' privileges differed in
each3 the power of the Mayor stopped short at the precincts of the
Close 3 and law-days were held in the Canons’ Bake-house for
the Bishop's Fee, or for that part of it inside the libel-ties
which was called afterwards the Canons’ Fee, within which the
City Constable could make no arrest. Each prebend had indeed
in some respecta like independence, and claims for its own law-
days and assize. Disturbers of the peace passed ιο a different
police system when they crossed a street, ιο the grave risk of
security and order. Some houses were partly in the Canons'
fee and partly in the King’s fee, and knavish occupante could
transfer their furniture from one side ιο the other, and so balk
the civic officers when they came ιο levy distraint upon their
goods. Collision between such vested rights was unavoidable‚
and in Bishop Peter’s time there was much hot dispute‚ after
which a formal memorandum of agreement was drawn up, and
enrolled by Royal mandate, November, 1262. of this a copy
was entered in our Register‚ called for doubtless by friction
existing at the time.⁴ Again the exclusive privileges of the
