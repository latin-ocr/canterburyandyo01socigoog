Dispute with Amanus of St. Asaph. xxxi

Bishop's Fair were in Hereford‚ as were the like elsewhere, a
constant source of irritation to the trading classes in the town.
Given by special licence from the Crown for a. fixed number
of days, and extended afterwards by further grant, these mono-
polies of barter stopped all competition while they lasted;
closed all the shops within the town ,- forced the country folks
and traders from a distance to pay the Bishop's tells, and buy
and sell only for his profit. The custody of the city gates
· passed into his keeping‚ while his men displaced the municipal
officiaIS, and made the most of all their short-lived powers.
The natural resentment of the townsfolk found expression at
this time 3 the bailiffs refused to give up the keys of the gates
as usual, in spite of the remonstrance of the Official of the
Bishop, and called forth from him a stern rebuke,² which seems
to have had effect, as we hear no more upon the subject.

The disputes with his lay neighbours coetld be settled,
though with some delay, in the King's Courts at home. There
was another of a different kind, which caused him far more
anxiety, and of ‘which he never saw the end. The hot-headed
and litigious Bishop of St. Asaph, Anianus ΙΙ.,2 laid claim to
the spiritual jurisdiction over several parishes in a district
called Gordwr, on the Welsh border, which had belonged to
the diocese of Hereford‚ thus repeating in another form the
aggressions of Llewelyn. The question was brought before the
Court of Rome, debated there, referred to Archbishop Peckham,
and judges-delegate in England, against whose action Cantilupe,
mistrusting their impartiality, appealed to Rome again, and it
was left undecided at his death. The subject constantly recurs
in his letters to his legal agents, and to friendly Cardinals and

othere, in connexion with the suit of Langon, and together
they made large inroads on his peace of mind and purse.³

had been Prior 01 the Dominican house at Rhuddlan. was a militant Crusader with
Edward 1: after his return home he was embroiled with Llewelyn. whom he charged
with wronging the monasteries of his diocese. A number of the Welsh cistercian Abbots
formally defended Llewelyn from this charge (Haddan and Stubbs. eouncils. 1. ⁴98). but
a Chat-ter of libet-ties was finally procured. 111 1110 Welsh war of 1282 the cathedral of
