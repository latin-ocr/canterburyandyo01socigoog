xxxii Introduction.

It has been argued that the common practice of direct
appeal to the Pope was beneficial to the suitors, and in the
interests of justice, since it saved the expense of litigation in
the courts of primary instance, and ensured the hearing of
the cases by competent judges‚ while the official of 8 bishop
might be biassed or ill-trained. The correspondence in our
Register furnishes some evidence of weight on the other side.
It illustrates in the first place the dilatory procedure of the
Papal Curia that allowed cases to drag on for many years,
as in both of those which have been lately mentioned. With
the tardy action of the com-ts we must connect the notorious
venality of high-placed officials there. A letter of Cantilupe
to his proctors deals with the arrangements to be made for
winning their support. Leading Cardinals are to be visited——
the common euphemism for the presente to be offered—and the
Bishop explains his views in some detail as to the way in
which the sum of a hundred pounds which he provides is to be
divided for the purpose. It is all that he can spare at present,
and evidently not enough, though equivalent to at least fifteen
hundred now. The Pope himself is named among the persons
whose favour is to be bought, though the writer includes
him with reluctance.¹ We must accept therefore with reserves
the ples, of justice ensured and expenses saved by such direct
appeals. As in other respects a wise and benevolent despot
could work the system to general advantage, but it might
sadly fail in weaker hands. of course it discredited the local
authorities in all lands, weakened their influence‚ and dis-

organized the Church.

In connexion with these negotiations at the Papal Curia we read
in all the contemporary documents of accredited financial agents,
and to these references frequently occur in the pages of our Register.
The Italian bankers seem in the thirteenth century to have
completely displaced in the higher regions of finance both the
J ewS, who had 8 practica} monopoly in earlier dayS, as well
as the detested Caorsins from the South of France,' whom
Grosseteste caIIS, “ the traffickers and bankers of the Lord
Pope.”⁸ They are spoken of as merchants, though we hear
