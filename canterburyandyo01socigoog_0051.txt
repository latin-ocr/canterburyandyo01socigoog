The Bashop's litiqious temper. xxxv

the royal pardon for euch trespass in the royal foreste, ¹ as
indeed did Archbishop Peckham‚’ though it may have been in
the case of Cantilupe some fault of the servants or foresters
that was thus excused. Each reference to Courts of Law taken
by itself is natural enough, shews no specially vindictive or
litigious spirit. But what may surprise us is the frequency
of their recurrence, and the large space in the Register which
is filled with legal process. How shall we explain this feature?
Had past neglect, and the weakness of his predecessor, made
it needful to enforce the assertion of his rights? Was such
resort to law but a more civilised form of the border warfare
which had been going on for centuries on the Welsh frontier,
expected therefore, almost required, by the public opinion of the
age and place? Had the long years spent in the study of
the civil and the Canon law, with the experience of the
Chancellorship at Oxford, influenced his judgment, and lessened
the distas-te, which might else be looked for in a Saint, for so
much legal phraseology and practice? His admirere testified to
the Commissioners of the placid calm and indifference to
personal slights with which he treated at Oxford the petulance
of wayward scholars,⁸ but the acrimony with which he com-
plained to the King that the quarters promised him at Powick
had been given to the Earl of Gloucester⁴ hardly agrees with
such accounts, and embarrasses to some extent our judgment.⁸

Much of his time was taken up with the endeavour to
enforce the canons of the Councils which were drawn up against
the plurality of beneficos in the Chumh, and the details fill
many pages of this book. It had been forbidden by the
Lateran Council in 1215, and the legate Otho had attempted
to carry out the rule in England, but was met, as has been
said already, with stout resistance from Walter Cantilupe of
Worcester. It had been, however, re-enacted by the Second
Council of Lyons, in connexion with the duty of the continuous
residence of the incumbent on his charge. Our Bishop acted
loyally on the instructions given, though the memory of his
