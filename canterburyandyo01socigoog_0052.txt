own antecedente must have made it, for him as for others in
like case, a most unplessing task. He had, it is true, enjoyed
the formal dispensatione, for these were readily obtained by
men of high rank or influenee like himself. But it required
some cour-age to insist—as indeed he rarely does—upon the
moral aspects of the rulo, on the personal oversight that was
implied in a. Rector's name and office. It was unfortunate
moreover that one of the first to suffer from the enforcement
of the rule was Hervey de Borham‚ Dean of St. Paul’s,¹ whose
name had been brought for-ward in competition with his own
at the election‚² and that several others -belonged to the Bur-
gundian, or intruded, element for which his sympathies were
scant. He did not act hastily indeed 5 he had the offenders
summoned time after time 3 waited patiently in court for the
attendance which they seldom made ; allowed excuses and
adjournments which it was open to him to refuse. They did
not take it seriously at first; were far away, or thought pro-
ceedings purely foi-mah did not at first present the pleas or
dispensatione which were valid3 and so we have a. tiresome
iteration in the entries, which recite the same facts repeatedly
without much seeming progress. At times a royal letter bars
the way,³ for the King will not have his clerks molested; or
dignitaries, or wealthy ladies beg for a reprieve, which he was
not unwilling to allow.⁴ For very few were heartily in earnest
in that movement of reform; most of the bishops were ham-
pered by their antecedente, unlike Bishop Peckham, who as a
fr iar had no past practice to clash with present theory3 he indeed
could denounce abuses which a King upheld, and refuse to confirm
the election of a. bishop who had been a pluralist himself.

John XXII. in the next century checked for a while these
practices by the sweeping messuros of his constitution
ExecrabiliS, but the whole system of dispensatione procurable
at Rome was a matter of favouritism and bribes‚ and there
was warrant for the trenchant language of Prynne. “ Not-
withstanding all former canons, yet through the avarice,
ambition‚ impiety of pluralists, dispensatione and contrivances
of Popes and Prelates for their own filthy lucre, they still
increased more and more, and continued unredressed as a. most
