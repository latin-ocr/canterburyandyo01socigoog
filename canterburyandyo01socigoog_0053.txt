growing mischief and cancerous ulcer past all cure to the

The obligation of residence could not be easily enforced,
especially by a Bishop who had ignored it for most of his adult
life. A constitution of Pope Boniface V111.¹ had sanctioned
dispensatione in the case of the many minore—kinemen often of
the patrone—instituted to parochial cures, for whom clerical
training, and even higher education with recourse to necessary
books could hardly be provided except at a centre of general
study. All the Bishops therefore granted licences to young
Rectors and Archdeacons to go to Paris or to Oxford to pursue
their studies, or have a pleasant time, if they were idle ς and
sometimes a tax was levied from them for the benefit of the fabric
fund of the Cathedral. The licences were limited commonly at·
first to one or two yearS, but occasionally they spread over as many
as seven. There was little security meantime that the purposes
for which these were granted were fulfilled3 the young incumbente
failed frequently ιο appear for ordination at the stated times, and
we hear therefore often of sequestrations for default.⁸ Men of
influence again and high-born ladies expected their nominees
to attend them as their private chaplains, and their desires
could not be always disregarded. The Crown had 00 scruple
in using its ecclesiastical patronage for the payment of its
servants, and angrily warned off the Bishop who was rash
enough to summon the non-residents to their cures.⁴ There
were many others who gave trouble; aliens intruded by pro-
vision of a Pope‚ or by a Bishop like Peter de Aquablanca.
It was difficult to learn if they had any special dispensation3
they were often far away, and repeated citations were required
to ascertain the facts; and hence the somewhat wearisome
recurrence of such entries in the Register, and the scanty
results of ineffectual attempts at discipline.

Among those who were cited on the ground of their non-
residence the names of portionists frequently recur. The
expression was a common one in those days ; it has not quite
disappeared from the diocese now. The prebende of the col-
