xxxviii . Introduction.

legiate churches of remote antiquity still here 81111 there
1011181ηο11 distinct, while the process 01 union 11811 gone 011
elsewhere,· the division of some mauors among co-parceners—as
the six who 81181011 Αο1011 Scott¹-—helped probably to preserve
the old type unchanged‚ 81111 may possibly have added to the
number 01 811011 08808. In the diocese 01 York, 88 we see in
the peges 01 15110 early Registers, the fusion 01 the several
portione went 011 rapidly in the thirteenth century 3 in the
diocese 01 Ηο1010111 they remained unchanged longer then else-
where. Besides Pontesbury 81111 Burford, which have their
three portionists still, there was the same system 815 Βο1110,’

warne⁷3 there were six prebende even in the King's Chapel of
Bridgnorth⁸ representing the 081101111οε existing in the earlier
days in the wide-spread maner 01 Morville. The portionists 01
Pontesbury 81111 Bromyard gave especial trouble to the Bishop3
those 01 15110 latter were 01 the Aquablanca 01811, 81111 81181011
1158 sels-assertion. Generally perhaps the portions were well-
endowed, 81111 many of them therefore passed into the hands of
privileged 8110118, who were non-resident, perhaps to the advan-
tage 01 the peace 81111 harmony of the divided parisheS.

The Register does not throw 11111 light on the conditions
of the religious houses at this time. During the few years
over which it spreads the Bishop did not find time to visit
many ς 15110 10111181 reports 011 1511080 which were visited by
himself 01· by his delegatos 810 11015 inserted; 81111 we have only
letters of general admonition to the monks. But these—like
other evidence of the period—imply thet the enthusiasm 81111

Leorm‘nster Priory‚ 01 which we 11081 15110 most, the financiel
conditions were so bad that the King took it under 1118 pro-
tection‚⁹ with the Abbey 01 Reading, 01 which it was 8 0011 3
this was 1158011 three times sequestrated by the Crown to pay
off its debts. There was much 1110151011 with the townsfolks
who complained that they were not allowed to ring the bells
