which they had bought themselves, or gain admission to the
church in which they had established rights. As in many other
cases the townspeople and the monks shared the use of the
same building, but at Leominster there was no solid partition
between the two portione, and to screen the conventual rooms
from trespassers the monks often closed the outer doors at
times when fugitives fled thither for sanctuary and priests
needed the viaticum. It was believed also that the customary
almsgiving had been curtailed and endowments misapplied. The
Bishop wrote repeatedly and in strong language on these
subjecte, but found much obstinate resistance.¹ The chief
change on which he had insisted was cancelled afterwards by
Archbishop Peckham, who ordered that a chapel' should be
built not far away for the needs which have been mentioned.
At a later period of the Bishop’s rule there was much scandal-
in connexion with the charges brought against the sub-prior of
incontinence with a nun at Lingebroke and with various other
women! The Abbot of Reading resisted episcopal interference
with the priory‚ claiming the exclusive right of placing and
displacing the members of the cell. This led to somewhat
bitter correspondence,⁴ but Swinfield in 1285 allowed the claim
after inspection of the early charters.⁴⁵ ’

At Wormesley the convent was found to be also deeply
in debt. It was necessary to make injunctions that women
should not be allowed at night within the walle, and that the
rules of silence should be better kept. Some of the brethren
were away in attendance on the inmates of great houses, and
these perhaps should be recalled.⁸ At Chirbury there had been
notorious scandale from the free access of women and others
to their buildings ; canons of doubtful character should not be
allowed to go out of doors except with companions who could
be trusted. Discipline within the house was much relaxed3
debts were dangerously large; alienatione of property must be
discontinued, and report made to the Bishop of the punishment
inflicted on members of ill-repute.'¹ of Lingebroke‚ which he
visited before the scandal above referred to was made known,
