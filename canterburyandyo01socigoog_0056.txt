xl Introduction.

the Bishop speaks in more sympathetic tonos, but implies that
their Rule was not carefully observed3 the restrictione
on familiar intercourse and personal property had been relaxed,
and more stringency of discipline was needed.¹ of the
intellectual condition of the inmates of the convente generally
he writes with some contempt, regarding them as utterly
ignorant in most respects‚ without independent judgment.'

In this, more than in most of the episcopal Registers of
early dayS, little difference is made between the documenta of
personal and official interest. We have letters and entries
therefore which have no connexion with the diocese, and among
them many which concern the maner of Earley, near Reading.
We learn from an entry in the Close Rolls of Feb. 3, 1276,
that Cantilupe‚ being summoned frequently to London as a
member of the King's Council. and having no convenient house
where he could stay with his servants on the way, desired to
have granted to him the custody of the lands and heirs of the
deceased Henry de Earley, until they came of age. The manor
was delivered to him by the King's steward on June 16,
subject to a payment of sixteen marks yearly.⁸ Next year,
J uly 7, the custody of the lands of Philip de Arneleye was
assigned him, and he paid a fine of two hundred pounds.⁴
Further entries deal with the lands of Stephen de Kentisbury,
who held of Philip de Earley in the Manor of North Pether-
ton. This, however, had been assigned to the Hospitallers of
Buckland, who were to pay henceforth to the Bishop the
twenty-one pounds of yearly rent which had been fixed.⁸ After
the Bishop's death the officere of the Crown claimed from his
estate the arrears of the sixteen marks for each year, without
regard to the fine of two hundred pounds, regarding the two
transactione as affecting different propertieS. It was ascertained,
however, that it was one and the same manor in question, and
that the name of Henry in the first deed was written in error
for that of Philip, and Arneley for Earley.⁶

For some years the Bishop travelled to and fro to attend the
meetings of the Royal Council‚ and in 1279 he with others
