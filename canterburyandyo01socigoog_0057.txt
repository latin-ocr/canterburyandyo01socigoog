The Bishop’s mauors and hou-see. xli

represented the King during his absence in France.¹ He had
also to be present at Provincial Synods‚ and there were fre-
quent journeys through his diocese. Like other lords of many
mauors in that age he passed frequently from one to another
of his large estateS, reviewing the accounts and business trans-
actions of his bailiffs, and with his numerous train consuming
the produce of his landS. These journeys were possibly com-
bined at times with formal visitations of the churcheS, when
some amount of entertainment was expected from the resident
Rectors‚ or the heads of religious houseS‚ when they had the
tithes‚ but there is little evidence of such visits in the Register.

Of the many manors included in the Episcopal estates a few
were favour-ite residences on a larger scale. Such was SugwaS,
with its timbered park and ample fisheries and close neighbour-.
hood to Hereford‚ in the heart of which he seldom cared to
stay. Bosbury, “ where the Bishops held their state and lived
in a fayre palace in the time of King offa,”² was another of
the best-loved manor houses‚ but since Bishop Scory dismantled
the Court Hall in 1572 nothing but an old gateway survives.
Whitbourne on the borders of worcestershire, with its wide
moat and Brinkestye wood to supply the fish and game needed
for his table, tempted often to a longer sojourn, and from this
many of the letters of the Register were written. In London
there was the town house given by Bishop Ralph‚³ which he
may have used, as Swinfield did,⁴ but there is no evidence of
this. Some of the documents are dated from Kensington,⁵
where a manor had been given in early times to the Abbot
and convent of Abingdon, on -the site of which Holland House
was afterwards built. Others were written at Tottenham
(Totenhalle),⁸ where the Prior and Canons of Holy Trinity
within Aldgate had the advowson‚ and perhaps a house in
which he may have lodged. Earley, near Reading, which he
practically leased by payment of a heavy fine, was a convenient
resting place upon the road.⁷ When he had occasion to go
further southward he stayed awhile in or close to what had
been his parish of Sherborne,⁸ probably as the Prior's guest.
