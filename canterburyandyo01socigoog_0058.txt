xlii Introduction.

We must infer indeed from the itinerary that in England‚
and later on in Franco, he accepted almost perforce the hoff
pitality of the religious houses on his road, when he passed
beyond the confines of his diocese. They were the recognized
hostelries of the Middle Ages 3 when they sued for the appro—
priation of the parishes of which they were the patrous they
insisted often on this burden‚ and a Constitution of Othobon
enforced the obligation in such cases to provide convenient
houses to entertain their guests.¹

There is little evidence of continuone residence at Hereford,
or of much use of the Hall, which then served more
as a C'ourt-house than a Palace.¹ These frequent movements
to and fro and this variety of homes may explain the insertion
of so many transcripte of much earlier charters. They were
needed for reference at times when the originale could not be
consulted, or were only to be found in different placeS. There
was no Bishop’s Registry in Hereford itself 3 some documents, we
know, were deposited for safety in the Chapter House of the Cathe-
dral,⁸ like the thousands of private chartei-s, quite unconnected
with the ecclesiastical estates, which were stored there for
safety during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and still
exist among the Archives. Others were placed—strange as it
appears—behind the High Altar of St. Paul's in London‚⁴ and
when the Bishop was leaving England, he wrote to the Dean
and Chapter to beg that his representatives might have access
to his deeds.⁶ Some perhaps were left in the manor houses
at Sugwas and elsewhere, and this may explain the loss of
most of the originals, while many of the charters of the Dean
and Chapter are preserved.

It has been noted that little regard is paid to chronological
order in the arrangement of the various entries. Some appear

to have been put in at hap-hazard3 but the most marked irregu-
larity is due to the insertion of the' copies of letters and granta
of earlier Kings and Bishops, or the records of proceedings in
the Courts‚ for which search had been ‚made in connexion with
some passing need. Disputes with the town, for example, would
lead to inquiry into the privileges granted and confirmed by
various monarche,⁶ as also to the formal agreements made which

were afterwards enrolled by royal order.'¹
