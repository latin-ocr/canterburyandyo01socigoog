Earlier documents inserted in the Reqister. xliii

Claims made by officere of the Crown for the ari-ears of
subsidies or scutages from the Episcopal estates may account for
the lengthy copies of financial statements connected with Peter
de Aquablanca and John le Breton.¹ Any question raised as
to the charitable distribution of the corn charged on the
manor of Holme Lacy might cause the clerk to hunt up the
original deed of the endowment of Bishop Peter, and write it
out in fun? The transference of the sum due from the estate
of the preceding prelate would require reference to the arrange-
ment of Bishop Ralph, which pledged him and his successore
to provide certain sums to be handed over at their death for
emblement and farm-stock.³ A new conveyance might call for
the inspection of the record of an earlier lawsuit, as in the
case of Cloppele and Ashe,⁴ or land at Whitbourne.⁶ A
disputed charge of synodale might give occasion for a view of·
the ordinnnce of appropriation of Great Cowarne Church.⁸ The
last of these may be found in the Cartulary of Gloucester
Abbey, but most of the rest would have been else unknown.
Thanks to these passing needs we have in the Register much
more varied entries and fuller information than could be
expected in the few years which it seems to cover.

¹ As there was no regular system of registration at this time,
nor recognised official for the purpose, much variety may be
naturally expected not only in the penmanship and style and
grammar, but also in matters of more moment, so far as they
were left to the discretion of the Bishop's clerks, Some
features of difference indeed between this Register and others
were due to the actual conditione of the See. Elsewhere man·
dates for institution were sent commonly to the Archdeacons,
and Deans were instructed to insta-ll canons. But at Hereford
the decanal office was practically in abeyance in consequence
of rival claims to it 3 the Hebdomadary or a Dignitary there-
fore took its place; the Archdeacon of Hereford was a youth
still in his studies, and the Archdeacom of Salop was in
disgrace. Rural deans acted in their stead‚ and some of them
had little cause to love their Bishop, who showered upon them
orders to serve citatione and excommunicate ‚offenders till their
office was no sinecure. On the other hand we hear nothing
