xlvi Introduction.

Cantilupe was vigoroue in lenguagc‚ mighty in sequestratione
and in excommunicatione, but few details are given of hie
corrective jurisdiction over the laity. Other Biehope left record
of the penancee impoeed on deliberate offendere—the public
fastigatione in the churchyard, as of the fifty seven at Yeovil 3 ²
the doleful processione of bare-footed and half-cled culprite with
the lighted cendles;² the crueade enjoined for the abduction
of two nuns 3³ but we do not learn how far Cantilupe was a
terror to evil dcere, clerical or lay, except when the righte or
property of the Church were in any danger. But if we mise
much that would throw light on the eeclesiastical or moral
conditione of the times, we have ample details of the techni-

then returned, giving up hie intended journey‚ on which no
light ie thrown by any information which we have. Next year
however events occurred, which resulted in a long absence from
hie See. A matrimonial suit between Petronilla Bebler end
Richard de Bramford was brought before the Court of the
Dean'e delegate—called the sub—dean-—at Hereford. Richard,
against whom sentence was given, appealed to the Court of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, ignoring the intermediate
tribunal, that of the Bishop of the diocese. The sub-dean,
dieregarding the prohibition to proceed which was sent to him
in due course, had Richard and hie agent arreeted‚ and flung
in the mud the letter of the official of Canterbury, who had
fined him ten marks and insisted on his prompt obedience.
