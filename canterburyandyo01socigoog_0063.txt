The retirement to Normandy. xlvii

years later disputed questions of jurisdiction between the Arch-
bishop and the Suffragans were referred by Peckham to four
experte, they decided that it was contrary to established usage
for the Official at Canterbury to receive appeals from suitors
in other dioceses before the matters had been brought before
the Courts of their own Bishops in each case. This decision
therefore negatived the claim which had been made to interfere
at Hereford. At this stage Peckham himself, who had not
long been consecrated, took no active part in the proceedings;
the subject is not 61611 mentioned in his Register, but it seems
that Cantilupe, unwilling to suffer from the 61161161161011 of his
chapel and the threatened interdict, resolved to leave England
for a while, probably that he might have time to refer the
matter in dispute to Rome. Indeed it seems that he must

chair was vacant from August, 1280, to March, 1281, and his
retirement lasted longer than might have been expected.

Before he left he was allowed by royal 11061106 130 111011κ16 111

As Becket sought the cloistered calm of Pontigny to escape
from his embittered relations with King Henry, so Cantilupe
retired to Normandy when the disputo with the Official of
Canterbury was at its height. The district which he visited
must have seemed familiar -to him from the associatione of the
past, close 66 113 was to the village from which probably his
family took its name, and to Breteuil which the first Earl
of Hereford had owned, and to Gournay and Evreux, the
names of which 1116 mother bore, first as daughter then as wife.
