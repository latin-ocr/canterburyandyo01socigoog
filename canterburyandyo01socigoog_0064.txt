xlviii Introduction.
—————-——————————-—————„
The Abbey of Lyre, in which he found a welcome, had special

'claims on his good will; its head was ex officio a Canon of
his own Cathedral ;¹ its financial agent lived in Castle Street
in Hereford, from which centre he administered some of the
conventual estates in England3 a william of chantelou—per-
haps the Bishop's grand-father—had renounced his title to a

fief in favour of the Abbey 3 two valuable benefices‚ Shinfield
and Lydney had been transferred by it to his Chapter. In

the midst of a gently undulating country the little Risle wanders
through a fertile valley in which for two centurias already the
monks of Lyre had made their home thanks to the pious
liberality of william Fitz Osbern and Adelisia his wife. The
shell of the Abbot's lodging and part of -the stables are still
standing, in which the village Cure and innkeeper are housed
respectively 3 the fishponds too can still be seen ς but beyond
the sculptures of the high altar, which were carried at the
Revolution to the village church hard by, nothing else remains
of the buildings of a prosperous community of forty to fifty
monks, multiplied indeed now -tenfold by local fancy, and so

well endowed that the inventory of its charters is spread over
four large folio volumeS.⁴³ From these it appears that it claimed
to have in England forty-eight churches and eleven chapels,
or at least some grant of tithes or pensione from them. A few
years after his stay at Lyre it was popularly believed that a
child had fallen into the Risle and was brought out dead, but
was restored to life by the efficacy of the Bishop’s prayers. ⁸

Here or in the neighbourhood he appears to have remained
for at least a year. Some official entries in the Register are
dated from other religious houses, such as the Abbey of Conches

close by which had property in his own diocese,⁴ and possibly
Fontaine Sor6t‚⁵ where a Prior-y of Bec was settled. But
these perhaps were only passing visits on his way to and fre.⁶

l-By a charter of 12oe the Abbot of Lyre was made a Canon of Hereford (lathem-al.
to which some advowsons had been transferred. The Abbot of cormeilles enioyed the
same privilege. The Chapter of Chichester made the Abbot of Grestein a prebendary at
the end of the l2th century: the Abbots of Athelney and Muchelney had prebends at
wells: and for a short time in the l2th century the Abbot of Bruton was ex officio a

Canon of contances. 2--This is now in the Archives of Evreux.

6-1n the course of these movements he may naturally have stayed at other places.
ln the Hospital at Lisieux certain pontificals are exhibited as having belonged to st.
Thomas of Enalandz at Argentan a comb is shewn which according to the local tradition
was used by the same Saint when „repar-ing to officiate in the chapel. lt ia supposed
that St. Thomas of Canterbury left them there. but there is no evidence that he
visited those towns during his long stay at Pontigny and vezelai and elsewhere: it is
possible that St. Thomas of Hereford should have been named.
