and to deal with his recalcitrant Official. As he repeatedly
refused, on the ground that notice of appeal to Rome had
been already given, he was warned that he had fallen under
sentence of excommunication. His letter of Jan. 7, 1282, in
reply to the Archbishop‚ is respectful and dig-nified in tone 3
it is to be found, not in his own Register‚ but in that of
Canterbury.¹ In an interview between them the Primate seems
to have promised that if Cantilupe would submit to his ruling
as to the matters at issue, 116 would practically refrain from
any exercise of the powers which he claimed.² The Bishop‚
with whom it was a question of principle, not of personal
dignity, naturally could not accept this offer3 and on J an. 15
he sent a clerk to the Archbishop with notice of appeal from
the sentence of his Court ς but at Lambeth in his presence 011
Feb. 7 Robert de Lacy, by mandate from the Primam, read
the formal warning that, if he declined obedience‚ 116 was then
and there under sentence of excommunication. The Dean and
Chapter on their part put forth an appeal against the claim
of jurisdiction in this case.³ Peckham's correspondence on the
subject betrays the worst features of his character, his
domineering⁴ and irritable temper and his free use of invec-
tives. His letters to his Proctors at Rome, to a friendly
Cardinal‚ and to the Bishop of London, whom he requests
repeatedly on Feb. 17 and March 15 to excommunicate the
offender in his name, abound in personal imputatione against
the man for whom he had felt singular affection as his bene-
factor and scholar at Paris, But now he can think only of
his obdurate contumacy‚ of his spirit of Dathan and Abiram‚
of his malice as a wolf in sheep's clothing‚ of his deranged
in-tellect, of his frivolous and blasphemous mendacitiesfi. The
bitterness of the feelings thus excited was out of all proportion
to the real importance of the matter in dispute3 it was further
increased by the opposition of his Suffragans—among whom he
believed that Cantilupe was a ringleader-—to the enlargement
of the jurisdiction of his Court. Twenty-one articles were
drawn up by them to express their grievances‚⁸ which are set
