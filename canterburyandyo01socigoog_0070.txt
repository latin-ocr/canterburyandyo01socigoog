lii Introduction.

Of the remains which had been brought to England the bones
were laid to rest awhile in front of the altar in the Lady
Chapel at Hereford, while the heart, which had been
bequeathed to Richard, Earl of Cornwall,¹ was taken to Ash-

ridge, near Berkhamstead, where a monastery of the Order
of Bonhommes had been founded already by the Earl, and a
resting place was given to the relic in the Choir of the

cenventual Church.² It was said that Peckham forbade at

first the interment in consecrated ground, till he was informed
that absolution had been given him by the Pope's desire, and
it appears that a letter to that effect from the Pope's Peniten·
tiary was actually shewn to him at Leominster in December,
1282.³ At a much later date Bishop Oldham of Exeter died
excommunicate, and could not be interred duly till absolution
came from Rome. Strange fancies came to the birth in after
years that, as the bearers passed through the diocese of Canter-
bury with their precious height, the blood pom-ed from the dry
bones, and that Peckham became childish in his later years as
a punishment for his vindictive temper.⁴ Several of the
Bishops lost no time in showing their sympathy for Cantilupe
and their practical disregard of the Primate's censures. The
very year of his death an indulgence of forty days was offered
by Godfrey Giffard‚ of Woroester, to all who would pray

devoutly for him at Hereford3 this example was followed by
the Bishop of London in 1285 and at Rochester in 1286.

Archbishop Peckham indeed issued a notice of a like indul-
gence from Lugwardine in 1282, but its object was the
improvement of the fabric of the Cathedral‚ and not a word
was said of the late Bishop.⁶ Five years later (1287) the
remains were taken from the Lady Chapel and transferred

to a place close to the altar of St. John the Baptist in the

North Transept‚⁸ where a worthier monument had been erected

knew nothing apparently of any further removal from that place.
