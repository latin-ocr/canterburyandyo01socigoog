Mysterious tokens of approval from the spirit world accom-
panied the change and were vouched for by Bishop Swinfield
who took a prominent part in the removal.⁴³ Then came an
outburst of enthusiastic faith. The good news spread apace
that a beneficent influence was potent there3 the impotem,
the siclt, the fearful in dire peril called on his name and
found a speedy help 5 pilgrims flocked from far and near to
shew their thankfulness for mercies given, or beg for blessings
yet in store. The monument was overlaid with precious gifts ς
votive offerings were hung up on every side 3 silver figures of
the votaries themselveS, or of the bodily members on which
the cure was wrought 3 silver boats given by mariners who had
been saved from raging storms 3 weapons that, but for like

grace, had inflictos deaffly wounds.³ The roya1 famfly and'

great nobles visited the tomb‚ and the excitement spread for
eighteen years with unabated force.⁴

When the concourse of the pilgrims to· the tomb was at its
height a curicus dispute occurred which may serve to indicate
the large number generally present. It was the custom—a.
purely English one according to the Bollandist writer—for
those who hoped to profit in health by their visit and their
prayerS, to have themselves measured and to leave a wax taper
of their own length at the tomb. These tapers were so
numerous, beyond the number that could be actually used for
fighting, that they were valued in the Taxatio Nicholai, about
1291, at twenty pounds, at least three hundred of present
worth. Such surplus wax had been of old the perquisite of
the Treasurer ς now the Dean and Chapter claimed to share
the profit, and after some debate terms were agreed on in
1289 to the effect that during the life time of Luke, the
Treasurer, he should have two-thirds and the Chapter the

was far out of man’s reach: and the heavy stone over the vault was easily removed by
two domestic nages. though it required ten men to replace it.

4—-1t is curious that at this tlme‚ when the gifts of the devout came pom-ing into
the ‘rx-casum of the eathedral. a Canon. Alan de Crenpinge. who was watching the
intes-ests of the Chapter at Rome and had to svend largely on its behalf. was threatened
with excommunication if he did not repay the sum of sixty marks which he had borrowed
for the Chapter from money-lenders of Pistola. (Document in the Archives of the D. ἁ
C.. dated 1290).
