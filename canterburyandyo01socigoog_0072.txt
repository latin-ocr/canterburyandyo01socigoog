remainder.¹ He must have died soon after and disputes again
arose with his successor John de Swinfield3 in 1293 it was
decided to refer the question to the arbitration of the Bishop.²

As early as April, 1290, Swinfield had addressed a letter to
Pope Nicholas IV, urging the canonization of his predecessor.
In 1292 the Bishops of Ely, Durham, and Bath and Wells
made a like petition to Pope Celestine ; Swinfield wrote again
to the same effect in 1299. No answer appears to have been
received. In 1305 the Magnates of England sent a weighty
letter to Clement V, asking that the wonder-worker might be
canonized 5³ this was signed by Edward 1.‚ who also wrote
private letters on the subject to the Pope and to a Cardinal,⁴ after
special appeal had been made to him by the Bishop and the
Chapter of Hereford.³

A commission of inquiry into the life and miracles of
Cantilupe was then appointed, consisting of the Bishops of
London and Mende with the Nuncio in England‚ william de
Testa. These held their first meeting on July 13, 1307, in
the Chapter House of St. Paul's. Their primary duty was to
ascertain how far the anathemas of Peckham and his Official
had been pushed 5 was Cantilupe really excommunicated by
them? The language of the Primate in his letters seems to
leave no doubt that the sentence had been issued ;⁸ but the
commissionem, after seeing the official documenta of the Court
of Canterbury, and learning what had passed at Orvieto and
Monte Fiascone, decided that he was not actually excommuni-
cate at his death. Either the sentence was conditional as
pronounced‚ or the appeal to the Pope which had been already
made, or Papal absolution at a later stage, deprived the
sentence of its force. This preliminary question settled, the
commissionem—without the Nuncio—betook themselves to- Here-
ford, where they stayed from August 30 to November 16,
witnessing themselves the concourse of pilgrims and the profuse
