lvi Introduction.

Eilgrims with their offerings were then thronging round the
tomb, making it impossible for building operations to be carried
on. The style of the work also points to an earlier date, or
at . least to an enlargement designed probably when the whole
transept was remodelled, though the work itself may have pro-
ceeded slowly. The position of Bishop Peter's monument proves
almost certainly that the aisle was in course of completion
before the tomb was erected‚ and before there could have been
any thought of preparing the Transept to be the resting place of
the Saint's relies.

But the indulgences offered by the Bishops in 1282 and
following years, more perhaps in number than the few of which
the evidenoes now exist, may throw some light upon the matter.
The enlargement may have been going on for some time, and
appeal made for outside help, of which indulgences of this kind
were a common form. The devout who came to pray at
Hereford did not come empty-handed‚ and their alms collected
for some years might provide a fitting resting place for the
monument which was now to be erected there. The Cathedral
had then no fabric fund ς 13118 tithes of Shinfield had not yet
been appropriated for the purpose; and the compotus rolls of
this period assign only the equivalent of the stipend of one
resident canon—of whom there were fifteen to twenty—to the
opus ecclesiae, or the maintenance of the buildings. Nothing
more than the ordinary repairs of the scantiest kind could be
undertaken without a special appeal for help from other
quarters. This came in abundantly when the fame of the
wonder-working powers spread abroad, and the commissioners
may easily have misunderstood 13118 information given them, and
confused the earlier work, which was completed shortly before
the excitement of the marvels spread abroad, with the much
larger expenditure which followed. A fabric roll of 1291
survives‚ in which we see that sums amounting 130 four thousand
pounds in present value‘ were spent on the buildings in that
year, nearly all of which was provided by the offerings at the
tombs The years immediately before and after doubtless saw
like lavish gifts and like expenditur-e. We have the receipts
of London merchants who provided the electrum for the decora-

tion of the monument, on which about a thousand pounds in
