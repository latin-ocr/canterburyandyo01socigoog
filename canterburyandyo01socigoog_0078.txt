At length, however, John XXII. despatched a Bishop to make
more inquiries ;² and the long looked-for Bull was issued on
April 17, 1320, to sanction a title already given by the popular
voice, and to order the observance of the festival on Oct. 2.

The King wrote⁸ that he intended to be present at the
ceremony of translation3 but this for some reasons unexplained
did not take place for many years, and though three historiens
mention the fact itself they tell us little of what passed,⁴
save that the King was present at the ceremony‚ with many
prelatos and nobles, and a multitude of other people. Perhaps
the large expenditure upon the buildings had delayed the
translation and the erection of the Shrine which appears to have
been set up in the Lady Chapel‚ where the relies were stored
near their first testing place in the Cathedral.⁸ Pilgrims
indeed were now comparatively few,⁸ and the offerings small;‘¹
but there the bones reposed⁸ till the days of desecration and
of pillage‚ when rude hande were laid on the riches of the
Shrine and the relies flung aeide as worthlees trifleS. Some
indeed were gathered up with leving care, for there were many
of the old saith—the so-called Recusants—in Hereford3 tradition
has preserved the names of the priests and others through
whose hands they passed, and some account of the gifts which
were made of them at various times, in the course of which
an arm-bone was placed in a college of St. Omer, but dis·
appeared at its suppression after its transference to Bruges3
a shin bone, it is said, remained in the keeping of the J esuit
Fathers and is still preserved at Stonyhurst.⁹

It is not surprising, therefore, that no remains were found in
the tomb when it was opened by Dean Merewether in 18463
