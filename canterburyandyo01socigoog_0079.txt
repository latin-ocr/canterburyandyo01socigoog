The character of Cantilupc. lix

indeed the Priest of the neighbouring Chapel who was invited
to be present at the time, knowing more of the history of the
relies, seems to have expected that result. The monument
itself was at that time brought forward a few feet from the
wall on which one end before had rested.¹

Some estimato of the character of Cantilupe, and of his
relations to the times in which he lived, may naturally be now
expected. His age was one of wonderful manysidedness and
teeming life. The enthusiasm ot' charity in the movement of
the Friars had fired countless hearts as it had not done since
the early days of Christianity; an ardent thirst for knowledge
sent its swarms of votaries to beg their way, if need were,
to the great scats of general study, while riper studente gave
new form to the knowledge of the past in their comprehensive
encyclopedias of learning. New theories of government were·
coming to the birth, with representative systems to replace the
old feudal forms of Norman monarchy. Fore-gleams of science
lighted up the ‘cells of lonely thinkers‚ like Roger Bacon‚ that
might with happier encouragement have anticipated the work
of later times. The instinct of a larger humanism was dis-
crediting the old conventual ideals‚ and Art was finding in its
decorative forms the loveliest creatione of the Architectural
genius of the West. Meantime the instinct of justice combined
with national prejudices to call out a passionate resistance to
civil and ecclesiastical abuses. How far was Cantilupe typical
of his age, and in what did his saintliness consist?

Some of the features which have been referred to were
represented fully by the student in Arte and Theology‚ the
trained Civilian and Canonist, by the friend of de Montfort‚
and the patriot jealous of aliens intruded in the offices of the
Church. His large hearted and systematic charity was a main
theme of his admirers' praises‚ as well as his persistency and
courage in the defence of the rights for which he was trustee 3

Ι-Τὴοτο is no evidence that the monument had ever been moved far from ite present
place In the North Transeat. We read only of the translation o! the relies, and of the
Shrine in the Lady Chanel. which was probably destroyed when the relies were diener-sed.
1! the heavy structure in stone had been transferred there with the shrine. there could
be no reason for a subsequent removal to the Transeot. where the tomb must have been
then known to be empty. There ie no very early reference to the monument itali: the
solid slah on which it reste hae nome cervina on its unper face now covered. and had
eerved before tor other ueee: the decorative treatment has no amiel appropriatenese for
a Biehon and a saint: and the whole question presente difficulties which are not easily
explained.
