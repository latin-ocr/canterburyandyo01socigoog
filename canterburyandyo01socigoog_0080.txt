lx Introduction.

but they dwelt with equal fervour on qualities less winning to
our eyes—the survivals of the ideals of the past. Not only
did he grudge the body's simplest needs‚ and rise from table
alway8‚ by his own admission, with a sense of unsatisfied
desire ,- ¹ not only did he excite the admiration of his servants
by the filthy hair-shirt with its handful of lice that stirs our
loathing ς’ but he shrank even from loving intercourse with
his own sistere, repelling their advances with a sort of Mani·
chean rigour‚ which became, it seemed‚ the Saint, but was
quite unlovely in the man.. His friends said much of his
equanimity and patience, and there must have been something
genial and winning to attract the sympathies and reverence
of men like Swinfield, Robert 13 Wyse, and Ralph de Hengham,
to say nothing of his household servants. But we may wonder
to see the signs of what we should else call a litigious and
unyielding temper, in which personal antipathies were carried
fat-3⁵ We may note with regret that he denounced all social
intercourse with J ewish neighbours as the enemies of God and
man, for whose expulsion from the kingdom he was urgent3 ⁴
he even begged with tears that he might retire from the
Council Chamber when it was once proposed to give a con·
verted J ew authority to punish Christian rog-ues.⁸

His ideal of charity was doubtless not confined to almsgiving,
nor his sels-denial to mere asceticism‚ but prejudice and obstinacy
had much to do with the litigation at Rome which dmined
his purse and tried his temper. Incorruptible as a. judge him-
self, he yet stooped to bribes to gain his cause, and proposed
to his representatives to move in crooked ways. It startles
us to read that his confidential agent—not regarded as very
scrupulous by his rivale—begged him to dictate only such a
course of action as would be honourable and just.⁶

The last English Saint recognised by the undivided Western
Church was still of the true medieval type, austere in his sels-
discipline‚ fearless in the assertion of the Church’s seeming
rights, but narrow in his symp-athies, stern in his coercive
moods, with more of the spirit of a Dominio than of a Francis,

and therefore somewhat unattractive to our modern testes.
