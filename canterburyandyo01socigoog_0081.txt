THE BISHOP’S INOOME.

 

The official income of the bishopric of Hereford is not put
at a high figure in contemporary documents. The Taoeatio Nicholai
of 1291 returns it et 2449 ls. 5d. in temporale alone, including
sn item of 244 26. 61],(1., the velue of property in the diocese of
Worcester at Prestbury, Pulcomb‚ and Sevenhampton‚ and another
of 210 for land at Eston in Wiltshire, but omitting the value of
the house in London which was given to the See by Rclph of
Maidstone. In another account of the same survey the lands in
Worcestershire and Wiltshire are not included, and the whole
exceeds 3500 per annum.1 Cantilupe had also by Pepal grant
the income of tithes in Ledbury end Bosbury appropriated to his·
table, on the ground of the meegre provision for a Bishop's
wants.² It was called indeed by Swinfield the worst endowed
Bishopric in England,⁸ and its twenty-three manors⁴ gave but a.
modest sustenance compared with the fifty of winchester, some of
which were large and rich. Lydbury North indeed covered a. great
extent of land but was returned et a low value, and this was due
perhaps to its position on the Welsh border, where it ·we.s exposed
to plundering forays.'1'hough the actual velue of this· income was
probably much larger than the taxable amount, Cantilupe was a
poorer man as Bishop than as pluralist before, for he is said to
have derived from his various prefer-ments a. sum as large as his
episcopal income,⁶ and though he spent freely on the buildings of
his many parishes, and was munificent in charitieS, he had time
to accumulate considerable savings. These he needed for the great
expenses of the first year or two of office, though he may not
have had, like Peckham and others who gained their Sees by
Papal provision, to pay great sums to the Court of Rome. His
predecessor died in debt, and money due for the cattle to stock
the fartus was not paid till September, 1278 ;⁸ the charges on
account of dilapidatione were probably delayed if paid et all.
