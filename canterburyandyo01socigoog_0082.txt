lxii Introduction.

A large fine was paid by him for the custody of the maner of
Earley, as also sor the purchase of the wardships in the Marmion
estates, and these must have been drawn from private funds.
But the costly litigation caused by his ill-advised acceptanee of
the prebend of Preston, and his unwillingness to reinstate Peter
de Langon when he vacated it himself, together with the dispute
as to jurisdiction with the Bishop of St. Asaph, brought vexa-
tion and embarassment that ended only with his life. Proctors
and advocates had to be paid, and presente given to Cardinals and
others who had to be conciliated; such expensos were a constant
drain, and we find many indications of it in his letters. He bor-
rowed a hundred pounds from William de Rotherfield, Dean of
York,¹ in 1276, and gave powers to Nicholas the Penitentiary to
contract a loan to that amount at Rome in 1278! The executors
of his brother Hugh lent him §3102 6s. ed. in 1279 ;⁸ Peter of
Ghester, Canon of the Cathedral, found him a hundred marks ;⁴
with the consent of the Chapter he took two hundred marks
from a reserve deposited in the treasury,⁸ and he was indebted to
John de Clare for eighty more!

There are no signs indeed of extravagance or careless manage-
ment; his letter to his SeneschaF implies a watchful scrutiny of
his accounts and effective control of his financial agente. The
sum spent on the livery of his servants, though equivalent to four
hundred pounds,⁸ compares favourably with that, nearly six times
as much, which Bishop Drokensford paid for the same purpose?
But an episcopal household was necessarily large; bailifl's and
farm-servants were numerous; repairs were costly in so many
maner houses,¹⁰ and the keep of the thirty or more horses needed
to convey his retinue from one home to another could' not be dis-

pensed with.

It is difficult to ascertain the amount and sources of his private
income. of the very large landed estates of his family not much
seems to have been ever in his hands, except for a time as
a guardian and trustes. We read of a little messuage in Lineoln-
