His private property ami leqacics. lxiii

 

 

shire held under Edmund de Dynecoui‘t ;¹ property in the Manor of
Barling was sold by him for sixty pounds in 1275,¹ but the
bailiff had not settled his accounts in 1279.⁸ Money was due to
him in Ireland,⁴ and he had estates in Somersetshire.⁸ The
mention of a bailiff in Charlecote (? in Warwickshire) points
to lauded interests there ;⁶ so also do the entries respecting
Madresfield (near Worcester) and Brodenbury.⁷ He had also the
Manor of Beflxham, which he sold to one of his pages, William
de Nevyle, for 240 166. ;⁸ the right oi advowson oi Alveston in
the diocese of worcester-⁹ is most easily explained by the possession
of a maner there. His frequent visits to 'I'ottenham (Totenhale ¹⁰
may imply that he had a manor house in that neighbourhood, or
he may have accepted hospitality from the Prior of Holy Trinity,
but this is only matter of conjecture. On the whole from the
very meagre references to him in the Hnndred Rolls, or im-.
mediately after his death in the State Records, ·we may gather
that his lauded property was small. He had special licence to
deal in his Will with the Manor of Earley,¹¹ and his interest in
that passed to his sister J uliana.¹⁵¹

His Will unfortunately has not been preserved, but we have
a list of the many legacies bequeathed by him, mostly in small
sums, to his clerks and personal retainers.¹⁸ These amounted to
about four hundred and fifty marks, and were all paid in 1282.
When the long suit about the prebend of Preston was brought to
a close at Rome, sentence was prononnced that the executors of
Cantilupe were to repay Langon 360 sor every year in which the
Bishop had detained the prebend. But Swinfield and de Montsort,
the executors, showed that they had nothing left of his estate.
They had laid out on his Obit what remained after payment os
the legacieS,¹⁴ together with provision for his funeral and monu-
ment, and had secured discharge from the Court os Canterbury.¹⁸
