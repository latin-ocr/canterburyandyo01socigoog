NOTE.

 

THE instalment of the Register of Bishop Cantilupe of Hereford now

issuedhas been transcribed and printed by the Cantilupe society,
in co-operation with this Society, as foreshadowed in the Annual Report
of last year. The whole Register, with the Introduction and Index, will,
it is expected, extend to about 400 peges,

Other work in hand includes: the Register of Bishop Halton of
Carlisle, part of which is alteady in the press ; the Registers ot Archbishop
Peckham and Archbisbop Parker of Canterbury 3 besides the remainder of
the Rolls of Bishop Hugh de Welles of Lincoln.

A further Part will be issued shortly, making the fourth this year, and·
will consist of ‘a further instalrnent of the Lincoln Reus. It is now in the
press‚ and it may be added that very nearly the whole of the Rolls of

Bishop Hugh have now been transcribed and will soon be in the hands of
the members.

The rate of progress is still comparatively slew, but arrangements
have been made which give every reasonable prospect of more rapid
progress in future, and allow of the hope that the Society will be in a
position to issue Quarterly Parts with regularity. More could be done is
the number of subscribere could be increased.
